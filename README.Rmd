`GVI` is a R package to calculate a Green Visibility Index (GVI) surface from a DSM, DTM and Greenness Surface as demonstrated by [Labib, Huck and Lindley (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143050). `GVI` is written in C++ to provide fast and light weighted functionality.

# Installation

`GVI` is still in very active development. Therefore, the package is also not on CRAN yet. You can install the latest version of `GVI` from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_git("https://github.com/STBrinkmann/GVI")
```

# Methods

## Viewshed

The `Viewshed` function computes the viewshed of a point on a Digital Surface Model map. A buffer is applied on the observer position, and for every point on the perimeter a Line of Sight (LoS) is being calculated. Visibility along every point on the LoS is computed using a C++ implementation of Bresenham's line algorithm [[Bresenham 1965](https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.41.0025), [Bresenham 1977](https://doi.org/10.1145/359423.359432)] and simple geometry.

## Viewshed Greenness Visibility Index (VGVI)

The VGVI expresses the proportion of visible greenness to the total visible area based on a viewshed. The estimated VGVI values range between 0 and 1, where 0 = no green cells are visible, and 1 = all of the visible cells are green.

A decay function is applied, to account for the reducing visual prominence of an object in space with increasing distance from the observer. Currently two options are supported, a logistic and an exponential function. The `visualizeWeights` function helps setting the parameters *m* and *b*.

# Examples

For the example we will use [Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/digital-elevation-model), a binary Greenspace Mask based on a [land cover classification](http://www.metrovancouver.org/data) and Digital Surface Model (DSM). The DSM is generated from [LiDAR data collected in 2013](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/lidar-2013/) and a detailed explanation on how the DSM has been generated using R is provided in [this](https://geobrinkmann.com/post/visible-greenness-exposure/) tutorial. To reduce the size of the R package, the data has been uploaded to GoogleDrive and needs to be downloaded first.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# build a temporary folder on disk
temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".tar.xz")
download.url <- "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Qb1bSh-ivWR7vZalxGQZw0JhIMVRKcN6"

## download the file
download.file(url = download.url, destfile = temp)
## unzip the file(s)
tar.dir <- tempdir()
untar(temp, exdir = tar.dir)
## close file connection
unlink(temp)
```

Load DSM, DEM and Greenspace Mask, and generate the observer location as an `sf_point` feature.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(sfheaders)

DSM <- rast(file.path(tar.dir, "Vancouver_DSM.tif"))
DEM <- rast(file.path(tar.dir, "Vancouver_DEM.tif"))
GreenSpace <- rast(file.path(tar.dir, "Vancouver_GreenSpace.tif"))

observer <- st_sf(sf_point(c(487616.2, 5455970)), crs = st_crs(26910))
```

Calculate the viewshed for a 300 meters radius around the observers position at 1.7 meters height.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
library(GVI)
viewshed1 <- viewshed(sf_start = observer, dsm_data = DSM, dtm_data = DEM,
                      max_distance = 300, observer_height = 1.7, plot = TRUE)
```

*Left: Digital Surface Model (DSM); Right: Viewshed, where green = visible and yellow = no-visible area.*

The Viewshed Greenness Visibility Index (VGVI) can now be calculated using the `vgvi` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
vgvi(viewshed = viewshed1, sf_start = observer, greenspace = GreenSpace, m = 0.5, b = 8)
```

The output of 0.86 indicates, that \~86% of the visible area, within a 300 meters radius, is green.

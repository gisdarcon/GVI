`GVI` is a R package to calculate a Green Visibility Index (GVI) surface from a DSM, DTM and Greenness Surface as demonstrated in [Labib, Huck and Lindley (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143050). `GVI` is written in C++ to provide fast and light weighted functionality.

# Installation

`GVI` is still in very active development. Therefore, the package is also not on CRAN yet. You can install the latest version of `GVI` from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_git("https://github.com/STBrinkmann/GVI")
```

# Methods

## Viewshed

The `Viewshed` function computes the viewshed of a point on a Digital Surface Model map. A buffer is applied on the point and for every point on the perimeter a Line of Sight (LoS) is being calculated. Visibility along every point on the LoS is computed using a C++ implementation of Bresenham's line algorithm [[Bresenham 1965](https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.41.0025), [Bresenham 1977](https://doi.org/10.1145/359423.359432)] and simple geometry.

*Left: Digital Surface Model (DSM); Right: Viewshed, where green = visible and yellow = no-visible area.*

## Viewshed Greenness Visibility Index (VGVI)

The VGVI expresses the proportion of visible greenness to the total visible area based on a viewshed. The estimated VGVI values range between 0 and 1, where 0 = no green cells are visible, and 1 = all of the visible cells are green.

A decay function is applied, to account for the reducing visual prominence of an object in space with increasing distance from the observer. Currently two options are supported, a logistic and an exponential function. The `visualizeWeights` function helps setting the parameters *m* and *b*.

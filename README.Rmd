The `GVI` R package helps researchers to calculate the Green Visibility Index (GVI) presented by [Labib, Huck and Lindley (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143050). The GVI is calculated using a Digital Surface Model (DSM), Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Greenness Raster. `GVI` is written in C++ to provide fast and light weighted functionality.

# Installation

1.  Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

    -   (Recommended) Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

2.  Install [terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra)

3.  Install GVI:

    -   Install remotes  
        `install.packages("remotes")`

    -   Install `GVIGVI` is still in very active development. Therefore, the package is also not on CRAN yet. You can install the latest version of `GVI` from GitHub with:  
        `remotes::install_git("https://github.com/STBrinkmann/GVI")`

# Methods

## Viewshed

The `viewshed` function computes the viewshed of a single point on a Digital Surface Model map. A buffer is applied on the observer position, and for every point on the perimeter a Line of Sight (LoS) is being calculated. Visibility along every point on the LoS is computed using a C++ implementation of Bresenham's line algorithm [[Bresenham 1965](https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.41.0025), [Bresenham 1977](https://doi.org/10.1145/359423.359432)] and simple geometry. The result of the `viewshed` function is a radial raster where 0 = no-visible and 1 = visible area.

## Viewshed Greenness Visibility Index (VGVI)

The VGVI expresses the proportion of visible greenness to the total visible area based on a viewshed. The estimated VGVI values range between 0 and 1, where 0 = no green cells are visible, and 1 = all of the visible cells are green.

A decay function is applied, to account for the reducing visual prominence of an object in space with increasing distance from the observer. Currently two options are supported, a logistic and an exponential function.

$$ 
\begin{align*} 
  f(x) = \cfrac{1}{1 + e^{b(x-m)}} && \text{(logistic)}\\
  f(x) = \cfrac{1}{1 + (bx^{m})} && \text{(exponential)}
\end{align*} 
$$

## Visualize Weights

The `visualizeWeights` function helps to adjust spatial weight parameters *m* and *b* used in the `vgvi` and `vgvi_from_sf` functions.

## Viewshed Greenness Visibility Index (VGVI) from sf

The `vgvi_from_sf` function combines the `viewshed` and `vgvi` functions. The input for the observer location is an [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) object (supports points, lines and polygons). If this object is a line or polygon feature, it will be converted to points. For every point, first the viewshed, than the VGVI is being calculated. The output of the `vgvi_from_sf` function is a single sf point object containing the VGVI of every point. This function supports parallel computation on Windows, Linux and MacOS, though it is highly recommended to use Linux or MacOS.

# Examples

For the example we will use a [Digital Elevation Model (DEM)](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/digital-elevation-model), a binary Greenspace Mask based on a [land cover classification](http://www.metrovancouver.org/data) and a Digital Surface Model (DSM). The DSM is generated from [LiDAR data collected in 2013](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/lidar-2013/). A detailed explanation on how the DSM has been generated using R is provided in [this](https://geobrinkmann.com/post/visible-greenness-exposure/) tutorial. To reduce the size of the R package, the data has been uploaded to in a separate GitHub repository and needs to be downloaded first.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Download DEM
DEM_tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
download.file(url = "https://github.com/STBrinkmann/data/raw/main/GVI_Data/GVI_DEM.tif",
              destfile = DEM_tmp)

# Download DSM
DSM_tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
download.file(url = "https://github.com/STBrinkmann/data/raw/main/GVI_Data/GVI_DSM.tif",
              destfile = DSM_tmp)

# Download GreenSpace
GS_tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
download.file(url = "https://github.com/STBrinkmann/data/raw/main/GVI_Data/GVI_GreenSpace.tif",
              destfile = GS_tmp)
```

Load DSM, DEM and Greenspace Mask, and generate the observer location as a `sf_point` feature.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load libraries. if one is not installed, use the "install.packages()" function
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(sfheaders)

# Load raster objects
DEM <- rast(DEM_tmp)
DSM <- rast(DSM_tmp)
GreenSpace <- rast(GS_tmp)

# Generate single observer point
observer <- st_sf(sf_point(c(492243.3, 5454231.4)), crs = st_crs(26910))
```

Calculate the viewshed for a 200 meters radius around the observers position at 1.7 meters height.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
library(GVI)
viewshed1 <- viewshed(sf_start = observer, dsm_data = DSM, dtm_data = DEM,
                      max_distance = 200, observer_height = 1.7, plot = TRUE)
```

*Left: Digital Surface Model (DSM); Right: Viewshed, where green = visible and yellow = no-visible area.*

The Viewshed Greenness Visibility Index (VGVI) can now be calculated using the `vgvi` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
vgvi(viewshed = viewshed1, greenspace = GreenSpace, m = 0.5, b = 8)
```

The output of 0.58 indicates, that \~58% of the visible area, within a 200 meters radius, is green.

We also provide sample data of a sf line feature to demonstrate the `vgvi_from_sf` function. This feature represents roads, that can be reached by walking within 5 minutes from our observer location.

```{r}
# Download line feature and load as sf object
isodistance <- read_sf("https://github.com/STBrinkmann/data/raw/main/GVI_Data/isoline.gpkg")
```

Compute the VGVI along the line feature. Since the resolution is 5m, points along the line feature will be generated every 5m.

```{r}
vgvi_sf <- vgvi_from_sf(sf_start = isodistance,
                        dsm_data = DSM, dtm_data = DEM, greenspace = GreenSpace, 
                        max_distance = 200, observer_height = 1.7, resolution = 5, 
                        m = 1, b = 3, mode = "exponential", cores = 20, progress = FALSE)
```

![](docs/VGVI_Isoline.png) *Output of the* `vgvi_from_sf` *function. Red points indicate low, green points indicate high values of VGVI. Paths and roads along the park tend to have high visible greenness, the road in the east has low visible greenness.*

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Delete raw DTM, DSM and GreenSpace files
rm(DSM, DEM, GreenSpace)
unlink(c(DSM_tmp, DEM_tmp, GS_tmp))
```
